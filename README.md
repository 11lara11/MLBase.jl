## MLBase.jl

A collection of tools to support the implementation of machine learning algorithms.

This package provides functions in following categories, which are commonly used in machine learning:
* Efficient matrix-vector arithmetic (e.g. adding/subtracting/multiplying a vector to each row/column of a matrix)
* Efficient column-wise or row-wise reduction
* Computation of column-wise or row-wise norms, and normalization
* Positive definite matrix related computation
* Integer related statistics

More functions may be added in future as needed.
